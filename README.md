## Author: Nhu Vo
## Date: April - Jun 2024

### Introduction
The **College Scorecard** initiative aims to improve transparency by providing students and families with the necessary tools to evaluate the effectiveness of higher education institutions in preparing students for success post-graduation. This project leverages data made available through federal reporting from institutions, information on federal financial aid, and tax records. The data span from institutional data files covering 1996-97 to 2021-22 and field of study-level data from 2014-15 to 2019-20.

### Data Source
Data are sourced from the [College Scorecard website](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/), managed by the United States Department of Education. It includes detailed information on over 6,500 universities and colleges in the United States encompassing approximately 3,232 data fields. Key data categories include:
- **Root**: Basic information about the data set.
- **School**: Identifiers, locations, degree types, programs offered, and student profiles.
- **Academics**: Types of academic offerings.
- **Admissions**: Admission rates and standardized test scores.
- **Cost**: Educational costs providing context on access, affordability, and outcomes.
- **Student**: Demographics and other details about the student body and staff.
- **Aid**: Expected student debt levels and loan performance.
- **Completion and Earnings**: Employment prospects and success in repaying student loans.
- **Repayment**: Insights into borrowersâ€™ behaviors post-graduation.

### Visualizations
This project utilizes advanced visualization tools to depict the intricate and multidimensional data in an easily understandable format for a broad audience. The visualizations address various aspects of educational data including:
1. **Distribution of Costs, Debts, and Earnings by School Type**: This includes a geographical representation and density plots showing the distribution across different types of institutions.
2. **Comparative Analysis of Tuition Costs and Post-Graduation Outcomes**: Scatter plots compare the cost of education to the earnings of graduates, highlighting differences among public, private, and for-profit institutions.
3. **Rates and Trends**: Box plots and comparative charts show admission, default, and repayment rates across different school types.

### Questions Addressed
1. Are tuition costs, debts, and post-graduation incomes similar or different across states?
2. Does spending more on education correlate with higher post-graduation income?
3. How are the costs distributed according to each type of university/college?

### Usage
To interact with the visualizations, users can select different data points and adjust filters to view specific subsets of data. The visualizations are designed to provide real-time updates and accurate depictions of the extensive information available in the Scorecard dataset.

### Conclusion
The visualizations developed in this project provide valuable insights into the outcomes of higher education, helping students, families, and policymakers make informed decisions based on a comprehensive analysis of institutional performance.
